## Important to know
I was unfortunetly blocked by lafourchette website and wasn't able to fix it. Thanks to Vidushan who gave me the offers he got from his script, i was able to work on the React.js part. I spend a lot of time on this lafourchette problem and i'm very frustated not to be abl to use my server side code. 

So there is no need to run the server side script because the json file that I use for the client side, is not the one I got from my code. 

The server side code is not returning a good json file because I wasn't able to finish it. 

## How to use it

To run the react application you must move to the client-side folder then run the npm install command. Then you can run the npm start command to launch the app on your browser
````
❯ cd client-side
❯ npm install
❯ npm start
````
